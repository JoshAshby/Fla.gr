I'm not a legal person, nor do I want to spend the time reading licenses, so
this is my version of my "please don't" license.

I'd like to have this licensed under the CCv3 NC-SA license however I haven't
read through most of the licenses for the various libraries, so theres probably
some stuff that might not make that fully possible.

Basically, if you use it, please give me some credit, and please don't sell it
or make money from the direct use of this source code in a commercial application.
Unless I can get a share, in which case email me, please.
