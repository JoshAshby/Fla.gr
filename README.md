Basically, I don't want to write how this all works, because I'm rewriting it
all, so heres to your hopeful intuition on being able to figure out what to do.
Makes use of various python libraries
redis
zmq
Seshat
SimpleDaemon

and probably a ton that I forgot, but they're all in the source, and as I get
time, and finish the rewrite I'll update this list to be acurate and well done,
along with better instructions on how to get things running. Until then, email
me if you have any problems.
